# MachineLearning--Univariate-and-Multivariate

This project the univariate and mutlivariate of training of the model has been done. That means how well
the machine learning model has learned the data you provided with the best results when you
give the test data to the model. It can be understood that if the model is not trained properly then
the accuracy and results won't be proper. It generally means using your hyperparameters , the
problem that was given to train the model are best suited to those with high accuracy. After
training your model, the test data is used to test the accuracy results of your model.
Some training examples where you can underfitting problems where the data scatter plots are not
in the same line but the training draws a straight line which becomes a bad fit. This is known as
underfitting because always the data may not be in a straight line.
For the overfitting, the complex model can be built if you tweak the parameters to a larger value
which will cause divergence, and that covers each and every data point which is an ideally
overfitting model. In this case a new point may not be generalized as everypoint is covered by
the model.
As shown in the above figure, for the above parameters the model was a best fit as it converges
the data points and the MLE is found to be nearer to these.
We should be careful while training the model, the problem function should be correct so that the
data the model is being trained fits well. The parameters you choose to tweak must be able to
show some change in the predictions of the model which will result in higher accuracy
predictions.
